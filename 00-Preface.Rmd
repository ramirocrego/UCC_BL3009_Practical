## Preface

Learning to use code to manipulate large datasets and conduct data analysis is becoming a critical skill for many professionals in the field of environmental sciences. This practical and tutorial will teach you the basics of using R to conduct data analysis using a long-term dataset of surface water quality and to interpret the results, linking real data to course theory.

### Learning Outcomes

You are expected to use your own computer for all exercises. By the end of 
this practical, you will be able to:

 * Understand R and R Studio interface
 * Understand the fundamentals of R code
 * Perform basic data analysis using a long-term dataset of surface water quality
 * Use R to create plots and summirise the data
 * Interpret water quality metrics

### How to use this material

Here I present a tutorial that will guide you on the use of different
R functions. I will walk you though the tutorial during the practical. You can use this tutorial as a starting point to use R for data analysis in the future.

The tutorial is organized in 5 main sections. 

- Section 1 is a basic introduction to R code. 
- Section 2 is an introduction to the use the R package dplyer to manipulate large datasets. For this, we will use a water quality dataset from China.
- Section 3 is a quick introduction to the R package ggplot to create nice plots
- Section 4 is an assignment. You will conduct an analysis on a similar water quality dataset for Ireland.
