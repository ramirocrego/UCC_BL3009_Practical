# Preface

Learning to use code to manipulate large datasets and conduct data analysis is becoming a critical skill for many professionals in the field of environmental sciences. This practical and tutorial will teach you the basics of using R to conduct data analysis using a long-term dataset of surface water quality and to interpret the results, linking real data to course theory.

## Learning Outcomes

You are expected to use your own computer for all exercises. By the end of 
this practical, you will be able to:

 * Understand R and R Studio interface
 * Understand the fundamentals of R code
 * Perform basic data analysis using a long-term dataset of surface water quality
 * Use R to create plots and summirise the data
 * Interpret water quality metrics

## How to use this material

Here I present a tutorial that will guide you on the use of different
R functions. I will walk you though the tutorial during the practical. You can use this tutorial as a starting point to use R for data analysis in the future.

The tutorial is organized in 5 main sections. 

- Section 1 is a preface. It shows you the basics of R and R Studio.
- Section 2 is a basic introduction to R code. 
- Section 3 is an introduction to the use the R package dplyer to manage large datasets. For this, we will use a water quality dataset from China.
- Section 4 is a quick introduction to the R package ggplot to create nice plots.
- Section 5 is an assignment. You will conduct an analysis on a similar water quality dataset for Ireland.

## What is R and why use R?

**R** is a very powerful statistical programming language that is used broadly by researchers around the world.  **R** is an attractive programming language because it is free, open source, and platform independent.  With all the libraries that are available (and those that are in rapid development), it is quickly becoming a one-stop shop for all your analysis needs.  Most academic statisticians now use **R**, which has allowed for greater sharing of **R** code or packages to implement their recommended methods.  One of the very first things academics often ask when hiring someone is simply, "Can you describe your **R** or statistical programming experience?"  It is now critical to have this background to be competitive for scientific (and many other) positions. 

Among the reasons to use **R** you have:  

1. It's free – open source! If you are a teacher or a student, the benefits are obvious.
2. It runs on a variety of platforms including Windows, Unix and MacOS.
3. It provides an unparalleled platform for programming new statistical methods in an easy and straightforward manner.
4. It contains advanced statistical routines not yet available in other software.
5. New add-on “packages” are being created and updated constantly.
6. It has state-of-the-art graphics capabilities.


**R** does have a steep learning curve that can often be intimidating to new users, particularly those without prior coding experience.  While this can be very frustrating in the initial stages, learning **R** is like learning a language where proficiency requires practice and continual use of the program.

Our advice is to push yourself to use this tool in everything you do.  At first, **R** will not be the easiest or quickest option.  With persistence, however, you will see the benefit of **R** and continue to find new ways to use it in your work.

## R or RStudio? How to get them?

**R** is available for Linux, MacOS X, and Windows (95 or later) platforms. Software can be downloaded from one of the [Comprehensive R Archive Network](https://cran.r-project.org/) (CRAN) mirror sites. Once installed, **R** will open a console where you run code. You can also work on a script file, where you can write and save your work, and other windows that will show up on demand such as the plot tab (Fig. 1).

**RStudio** is an enterprise-ready professional software tool that integrates with **R**.  It has some nice features beyond the normal **R** interface, which many users feel it is easier to use than **R** (Fig. 2). Once you have installed **R**, you should also download and install [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/).  For this course, we will work exclusively in *RStudio*.

***

Make sure you have installed R and R Studio. 

The last think you need is the data we will use. To make sure we are all organised, first create a Folder in your computer for this project. Name it BL3003. 

Now, inside this folder, create a new folder called Data.

Download the from this [drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1m5mXQ0wRhF1TEYcaGRTSy9Fsuuac0SXm?usp=sharing) and paste it inside the Data folder. There are two files, China_dataset.csv and Ireland_dataset.csv.

You are now ready for class :)
